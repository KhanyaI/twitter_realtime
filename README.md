# twitter_realtime

The streaming is based on the code from https://github.com/shihao1007/twitter_streaming_app

The goal of the code was to work with the twitter API, build a database and then plot it using dash.

The aim was to learn new libraries - tweepy, sqlalchemy and dash. The next step is to build a docker container and then deploy it using AWS
